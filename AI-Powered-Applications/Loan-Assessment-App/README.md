üè¶ AkSun Finance - Loan Assessment System

https://huggingface.co/spaces/chemman/Loan-Assessment-App

Problem Statement:
Financial institutions face significant challenges in accurately assessing loan applicant credibility, leading to either:

High default rates from approving risky clients
Lost revenue from rejecting qualified applicants
Time-consuming manual review processes

Solution:
AkSun Finance Loan Assessment App - An intelligent, data-driven solution that leverages machine learning to automate and optimize loan approval decisions with 85%+ accuracy.

Data Analysis & Insights
Dataset Overview
10,000+ historical loan applications
15+ features including demographic, financial, and credit history data
Binary classification: Default (1) vs Non-default (0)

Key Insights Discovered
Income-to-Loan Ratio is the strongest predictor of default risk
Employment length correlates strongly with repayment capability
Credit history length significantly impacts approval odds
Loan grade (A-G) effectively segments risk categories
Age and home ownership show moderate predictive power
